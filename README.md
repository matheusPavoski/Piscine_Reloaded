# Piscine_Reloaded
This is the first project we received as soon as we became cadets at 42. It consists of a series of exercises that help reinforce the fundamentals of the C language, which were covered during the Piscine immersion (the selective process to enter 42). Some examples of these fundamental concepts would be: loops, functions, pointers, and structs.
