[![mmaschio's 42 Piscine_Reloaded Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/clkblnlu7001608l83ar9hs4v/project/3159549)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)

This is the first list we received as soon as we became cadets at 42. It consists of a series of exercises that help reinforce the fundamentals of the C language, which were covered during the Piscine immersion (the selective process to enter 42). Some examples of these fundamental concepts would be: loops, functions, pointers, and structs.
